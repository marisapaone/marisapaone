👋 Hi, I’m Marisa Paone! 

👷🏻‍ I currently work as a Mechanical Engineer in the MEP Construction Industry based in New York City, NY. 

👀 I am interested in Java, C++, Python and Software Development. 

🐕 I am currently enrolled in a Masters of Science Program in Software Development at Boston University. Go Terriers!

🌱 I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I am coding, studying languages, or simply reading a good book. 

⛳️🏂🏐 I am an avid golfer, snowboarder, and volleyballer.
